# Fuel Tracker

## Development notes

This should be a single page application. There is no need for more. At the top of the page should be a search bar that will search against USDA food. Below it will be a day carousel showing the current day and the previous days may be viewed. On each day, just the calorie total will show. Below that will be the estimation of how many calories one should be eating.
